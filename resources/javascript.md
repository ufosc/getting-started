# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT (Just In Time)-compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is primarily used to add functionality to a webpage. Anything from modifying the page itself, to fetching content, logging in users, or holding a video call. 

While it is most well-known as the scripting language for web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 

Many people use JavaScript frameworks to simplify certain task or solve common problems. Some examples would be [React](react.md), Angular, or Vue. Each framework is designed for a specific purpose, and is usually not necessary for a basic website.
