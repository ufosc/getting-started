## How to help?

Please check the [Projects][Project Board] and [Issues][Issues] pages for current task. If you see something that you would like to help with, ask about helping in a comment and we'll assign it too you. If you're just starting out, checkout our [beginner friendly][Beginner Issues] issues for ways to help. 

Checkout the [DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) file for a high level explanation of the project. For a road map, look at the [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md) which lists planned features for the project. Check out the other files in docs for more information. 

### Report Bug 

Check to see if someone already reported this [bug][Bug Issues] already exists. If so then leave a comment on that issue. If not, please provide a detailed description of the bug. Include what was happening before the error, all settings, and test results. This helps us more quickly identify and solve any problems. Create an [Issue][Issues] with the description and add a bug label. We will do our best to respond quickly to it. 

### Request a Feature

Check to see if the feature is already listed in our [TODO.md](docs/TODO.md). If it's not, describe the feature and why it would be beneficial. Create an [Issue][Issues] with this description and add a feature enhancement label. We will do our best to respond quickly to it. 

### Run Test 

**Give detailed instructions on how to run the test. Also include information about the meaning of the results.**

### Submit Changes 

1. Create a fork or branch to tackle a specific issue 
	- Team members branch off of dev and follow this [guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) 
	- Others make a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
  - Name it after the issue or feature you are working on
2. Follow the style guidelines below
